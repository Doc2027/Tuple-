# Tuple Out game instructions

This program should be played in the terminal

> python tuple.py

The program will start by rolling the dice for you, and asking you if you would like to continue with an additional roll

if two of the dice have the same number they will be fixed, and the player will only be allowed to roll one dice untill they tuple out

tupling out is when all three dice match and the game will be over

the amount calculated will be the players score at the end of the game

on the players first game, this will be their high score.

As the player continues to play, they will be able to test their luck and continue to beat their high score.
